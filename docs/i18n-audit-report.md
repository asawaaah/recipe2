# Internationalization (i18n) Audit Report

This document outlines the findings from our comprehensive audit of the codebase to verify compliance with our internationalization best practices as defined in `languageWorkflow.md`.

## Executive Summary

Our application generally follows the established i18n guidelines, with most components correctly using the standardized approach. However, we did identify some issues that need to be addressed to ensure full compliance and consistent behavior across the application.

## Findings

### 1. Translation Hook Usage

✅ **Compliant**: Most components are using the standardized `useTranslation` hook from `@/components/i18n/TranslationContext`.

✅ **Compliant**: No references to the deprecated `@/hooks/useTranslation` hook were found in the codebase.

### 2. Links and URL Handling

❌ **Non-compliant**: The `src/app/page.tsx` file uses the regular Next.js `Link` component instead of `LocalizedLink`:

```tsx
// src/app/page.tsx
import Link from "next/link"
...
<Link href="/example" className="flex items-center gap-2">
  View UI Components
  <ArrowRight className="h-4 w-4" />
</Link>
```

This will cause language prefix to be lost during navigation from the homepage.

### 3. Hardcoded Text

❌ **Non-compliant**: The `src/components/blocks/login-form.tsx` contains multiple instances of hardcoded text that should be translated:

```tsx
<h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">Login to your account</h1>
<p className="text-balance text-muted-foreground">
  Gain access to your ultimate recipe collection.
</p>
<Label htmlFor="emailOrUsername">Email or Username</Label>
<Label htmlFor="password">Password</Label>
<a href="#" className="ml-auto text-sm underline-offset-2 hover:underline">
  Forgot your password?
</a>
<span className="ml-2">Continue with Google</span>
<div className="text-center text-sm">
  Don&apos;t have an account?{" "}
  <Button variant="link" className="p-0 underline underline-offset-4"
    onClick={() => router.push(signupPath)}>
    Sign up
  </Button>
</div>
```

### 4. Language Detection and Syncing

✅ **Compliant**: The `PreferencesProvider` properly extracts language from the URL path and syncs it with the stored preferences:

```tsx
// src/state/providers/PreferencesProvider.tsx
const pathname = usePathname()
const pathLang = pathname?.split('/')?.[1] as Locale
const isValidLocale = locales.includes(pathLang as Locale)
  
// Use path language if valid, otherwise context language
const urlLang = isValidLocale ? pathLang : contextLang

// Update state when URL changes
useEffect(() => {
  if (urlLang && urlLang !== language) {
    setLanguage(urlLang)
  }
}, [urlLang, language])
```

### 5. Translation Components

✅ **Compliant**: The i18n components are properly implementing the standardized approach:
- `LanguageSwitcher.tsx` - Correctly uses `usePathname`
- `LocalizedLink.tsx` - Properly preserves language prefix
- `TranslationContext.tsx` - Correctly implements the standard translation hook
- `SimpleLanguageSwitcher.tsx` - Properly extracts language from URL path

## Remediation Plan

### High Priority

1. **Fix Homepage Links**: Update `src/app/page.tsx` to use `LocalizedLink` instead of the regular Next.js `Link` component.

2. **Translate Login Form**: Add translation keys for all hardcoded text in the `login-form.tsx` component and use the `useTranslation` hook to retrieve translations.

### Medium Priority

1. **Review Other Authentication Components**: Check related components like signup forms and password reset for similar hardcoded text issues.

2. **Add Translation Tests**: Implement automated tests to verify that all user-facing components use translations correctly.

### Low Priority

1. **Enhance Documentation**: Update documentation to include specific examples for forms and authentication components.

2. **Consider Language Parameter in Path**: Review whether authentication pages should include the language parameter in their paths.

## Conclusion

Our application is generally well-structured for internationalization, with the major components following the standardized approach. The main issues identified are with the homepage's navigation links and the authentication form's hardcoded text. 

These issues are relatively easy to fix by applying the established patterns from our documentation. Once resolved, our application will have consistent internationalization behavior across all components and user flows.

## Next Steps

1. Create tickets for the identified issues
2. Prioritize fixes based on the remediation plan
3. Implement changes and verify they work across all supported languages
4. Re-run this audit periodically to ensure ongoing compliance
