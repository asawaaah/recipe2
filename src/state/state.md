The state management directory structure has been successfully created! Here's a summary of what we've built:
1.Providers:
AuthProvider.tsx: Manages authentication state using Supabase
ThemeProvider.tsx: Handles theme state (light/dark mode)
index.tsx: Combines all providers including React Query setup

2.Hooks:
useAuth.ts: Hook for authentication state
useUser.ts: Hook for user data
useRecipes.ts: Hooks for recipe operations
index.ts: Exports all hooks

3.Queries:
recipes.ts: React Query mutations for recipes
users.ts: React Query mutations for users
index.ts: Exports all query hooks

4.Utils:
storage.ts: Utilities for local storage
transforms.ts: Data transformation functions



We also have standardized react query usage. her'e a summary 

1.Created a dedicated QueryProvider component for React Query:
-Uses useState to ensure the QueryClient is created once and persisted between renders
-Sets up default options for queries (staleTime, refetchOnWindowFocus, retry)
-Includes the ReactQueryDevtools for easy debugging

2.Standardized query keys with a structured approach:
-Added recipeKeys and userKeys objects to create consistent, predictable keys
-Organized into hierarchical structure (all, lists, details, etc.)
-Makes it easier to invalidate related queries

3.Standardized query hooks:
-Created clean, focused hooks for data fetching
-Added support for filtering in useRecipes
-Improved the join syntax in useRecipe for related data
-Created a dedicated useCurrentUserProfile hook

4.Improved mutations:
-Updated onSuccess callbacks to use the standardized query keys
-Made better use of returned data to invalidate related queries

5.Simplified adapter hooks:
-Made hooks in the hooks directory simple adapters to the query hooks
-Allows for cleaner separation of concerns


This approach gives us several benefits:
-Consistent patterns across your application
-Better type safety with TypeScript
-More efficient cache invalidation
-Cleaner separation of data fetching from UI components
-Improved developer experience with standardized patterns



We also created a context-based state for UI concerns. Here's what we've accomplished:

1.Created a comprehensive PreferencesProvider that:
Manages user preferences like favorites, view modes, and UI density
Persists settings to localStorage
Provides convenient access to all preference-related functions
Is automatically loaded when the app starts
2.Added a specialized useModal hook for managing modal UI state, which is a common UI pattern.
3.Integrated everything into our main Provider structure.
4.Added proper typing for all preferences to ensure type safety.
5.Organized all preferences in a clean, maintainable way.

These changes provide several benefits:
Persistence: User preferences are now saved between sessions
Centralization: All UI preferences are managed in one place
Type Safety: TypeScript ensures consistency in how preferences are used
Separation of Concerns: UI state is now properly separated from server data state
The PreferencesProvider now gives your app the ability to remember user choices like:
-Favorite recipes
-Preferred view mode (grid vs list)
-Tag filters
-UI density settings
-Recent searches
This completes Step 4 of formalizing your state management. The context-based approach for UI concerns complements the React Query approach for server state, giving you a clean and maintainable state management solution.



We also created  a combined providers component and updating your application to use it. Here's a summary of what we've accomplished:
1.Created a new AppProviders component in src/state/providers/AppProviders.tsx that combines all of your providers in the correct order:
-QueryProvider (outermost for React Query)
-ThemeProvider
-AuthProvider
-PreferencesProvider
-TooltipProvider

2.Updated the providers index file (src/state/providers/index.tsx) to:
-Export individual providers for flexibility
-Export the combined providers as Providers
-Add a deprecated export of AppProviders for transition

3.Updated the app's providers file (src/app/providers.tsx) to use the new state management system by simply re-exporting the Providers component.

4.Created a central export file (src/state/index.ts) that makes it easy to import all state-related utilities from a single location.

5.Added comprehensive documentation in src/state/README.md explaining the structure and usage of the state management system.

This new structure provides several benefits:
-Centralized state management: All state-related code is now in the src/state directory
-Easy imports: Components can import state hooks directly from @/state
-Flexibility: You can use the combined Providers or individual providers as needed
-Documentation: The README explains how to use the state management system
-Maintainability: The structure is organized and easy to understand
Your application now has a well-structured, maintainable state management system that separates server state (React Query) from client state (Context API) and provides convenient hooks for accessing state throughout your application.



We now created  custom hooks for common state operations. Here's a summary of what we've built:
1.Recipe Actions Hook (useRecipeActions)
-Combines create, update, delete operations for recipes
-Handles toast notifications for success/error states
-Properly invalidates related queries

2.Profile Actions Hook (useProfileActions)
-Manages user profile updates and avatar uploads
-Handles validation like checking for duplicate usernames
-Provides loading and error states

3.Auth Actions Hook (useAuthActions)
-Handles sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out operations
-Supports both email/password and OAuth authentication
-Manages loading and error states
-Handles routing after successful auth actions

4.Favorites Hook (useFavorites)
-Combines local storage favorites with real-time recipe data
-Provides utilities for toggling favorites easily
-Fetches additional recipe data for favorite IDs


These custom hooks provide several benefits:
Encapsulation: Each hook encapsulates related functionality in a clean, reusable package
Consistency: Standard patterns for handling mutations, errors, and UI feedback
Reusability: The hooks can be used across multiple components
Simplicity: Components using these hooks have much cleaner code
By centralizing these common operations in custom hooks, our application is more maintainable and reduced code duplication. This approach also makes it easier to update your application's behavior in the future since changes only need to be made in one place.
